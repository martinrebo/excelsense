### DESCRIPTION
Project created as part of a job interview at Excelsense. 

Uses: 
- create-react-app / React Hooks
- Node.js Express.js 
- Rest API
- css modules




### TASK
 Endpoints:
Assets: https://6y458uslg3.execute-api.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/elixos/assets
Entities: https://6y458uslg3.execute-api.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/elixos/entities

### Description:
Using React.js and Node.js, you are asked to create an application to display in a grid view
(portal) the assets and its related entities. Also, for the entities, you are asked to create a
pop-up context menu (right-click).

### Details:
● The application must have 2 pages/routes. The landing page displaying the assets,
and the entities page.
● The grid view must be a component and the use of external grid/portal frameworks is
not allowed; we want to see how you create/structure components.
● Each portal must have a header row with the object keys of the assets/entities
(t_street_name, t_number, t_city, etc).
● To navigate from the assets page to the entities page, add a button to each row of
data of the entities grid.
● The pop-up context menu must have only 1 option-choice, named test, which will
print the id of the “right-clicked” entity into the console log.
● Have an “empty” row, where you can type and create new rows.
● Use git repository to track the evolution of the project.

### Extra Info:
● We will evaluate the functionality and aesthetic of the app and if the code is
well-structured and commented.
● There is no authentication/user control needed.
● Any extra development and personal ideas for the project will be welcome.
● The data provided has been generated automatically. Do not worry if it does not
make any sense.




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
